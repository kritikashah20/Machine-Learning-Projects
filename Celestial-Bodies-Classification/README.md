# Celestial-Bodies-Classification
A Machine Learning Project that helps scientists and even students to label a celestial body based on a variety of features like its gradient and standard deviation in a 2 dimensional space, etc. In this project, some models have been implemented, based on the same principles for classification of celestial bodies based on their features.
